                CCP Stands for College Credit Plus, these are classes at the college level that you can take during high school! 
                Northwest State Community College is one of the colleges that participate in the CCP Program!
                <br> <br>
                Classes in bold are classes I'm currently taking. I plan to take Composition 2, Trigonometry, 
                Financial Accounting, Database Management, and Python Programming next semester for CCP.
                <br> <br>
                These are not ALL of the classes required to get the degree, but these are a few to get you started.
